                <h3>How will my submission be evaluated?</h3>
                <p>Evaluation servers will clone the submitted code, build docker containers using a ubuntu docker image, and install packages listed in "apt.txt" 
                    using apt-get. Please make sure the packages listed in apt.txt are available for apt-get on Ubuntu 20.04. </p>
                <p>We use a modified modified Ubuntu 20.04 image, with make, cmake, build-essential and libboost-all-dev packages installed on default. 
                    You can use an example Dockerfile in the start-kit to build a docker image and test your implementation in a docker container.
                </p>
                <p>Evaluation servers will compile the submitted code in docker containers using the "compile.sh".</p>
                <p>The evaluation involves three steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preprocessing: If the implementation support preprocessing map data, we run the submitted program with the "-pre" flag for all the benchmark maps. All preprocessing data should be stored in index_data/ of the current working directory. 
                        These data will be accessible in validation and benchmark steps.</li>
                    <li>Validation: In this step, we run the submitted program with the "-check" flag, and validate the correctness of outputs.</li>
                    <li>Benchmark: In this step, we run the submitted program with the "-run" flag, and measure the performance of the submitted program.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The benchmark step guarantees that only one program is running on one computer.</p>
                <p>Please note, we will manually review the code when drafting the annual report to prevent any potential violation of fairness.</p>
            <h3>What are the evaluation parameters?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The evaluation server gives one CPU to the submitted program. </li>
                <li>If the program support multi-thread preprocessing, we give 4 CPUs for preprocessing.</li>
                <li>The preprocessing runtime is limited to 3 days per map, as some large benchmark maps may be time-consuming for preprocessing.</li>
                <li>The validation and benchmark runtime is limited to 4 hours per map. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do I test my implementation.</h3>
                <p>You can use any <a href="https://movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html">Moving AI benchmark instances</a> to test your implementation.</p>
            <h3>How many submissions are allowed?</h3>
                <p>You can submit as many as you want, but only one submission can be evaluated at the same time.</p>
            <h3>Can I submit as part of a team?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can. We will collect team information from participants.</p>
            <h3>My submission failed evaluation, what should I do now?</h3>
                <P>Read the error message and progress log in submission history. 
                    Try to debug your program locally on the same map.
                    Contact us on the discord server to seek further help.
                </P>
