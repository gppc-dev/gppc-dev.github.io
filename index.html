          <h2>The Competition</h2>
          <p>Grid-based Path Planning is a widely studied topic with many practical applications, such as robotics and computer games.
             It simplicity also makes it an excellent testbed for algorithmic evaluation.
              Many papers appear on this topic every year. The purpose of GPPC<sup>2</sup> is to provide a common
               experimental setup that allows researchers and practitioners to evaluate progress in the area.
               <br><br>The GPPC<sup>2</sup> is the fourth edition of the competition, with previous <a href="https://movingai.com/GPPC/">competitions in 2012, 2013 and 2014</a>.</p>

          <h2>How the Competition Runs</h2>
          <p>
            The GPPC<sup>2</sup> competition will run continuously until an annual report deadline. Submissions are welcome at any time before the deadline. 
            Participants can submit multiple times before the deadline and their submission will be graded automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system will evaluate submissions over a set of benchmark problems. 
            The evaluation includes three phases: 1) Preprocessing Phase. 2) Validation Phase. 3) Benchmark Phase.
            The preprocessing phase allows submissions supporting preprocessing to preprocess each benchmark map. 
            The validation phase feeds problem instances to submissions and validates their solution. 
            The benchmark phase times the running time of submissions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Successful submissions will be listed on the leaderboard, together with all other solutions.

          <h2>Winner Selection</h2>
          <p>
            There will be no winner for GPPC<sup>2</sup>. 
            However, we will report pareto frontiers in our annual report. 
            The authors of frontier solutions will be invited to write the report together. 
            The annual report will be published in the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS).
